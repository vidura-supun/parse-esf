# parse-esf

A Python utility for parsing Apple Endpoint Security Framework (ESF) JSONL log files into CSV format for analysis.

## Overview

macOS Endpoint Security Framework events can be exported as JSONL (newline-delimited JSON). This tool parses those logs and flattens them into a structured CSV, making it easy to analyze in Excel, pandas, or any data tool.

## Usage

```bash
python parse_esf.py <input.jsonl> <output.csv>
```

### Example

```bash
python parse_esf.py esf_events.jsonl esf_events.csv
```
